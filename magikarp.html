			a female and tan on a male." </blockquote> - Courtesy of Bulbapedia <br /><br />

		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<p><blockquote cite="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Magikarp_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Trivia">
		"Magikarp is based on the Asian carp, which are easily frightened by disturbances in water 
		and can jump 8-10 feet (2.5-3 m) in the air."</blockquote>
		<blockquote cite="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Magikarp_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Trivia">
		"Magikarp's evolution into Gyarados is based on a legend about how carp that leapt 
		over the Dragon Gate would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in 
		China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This legend is an 
		allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles. This may have 
		inspired an element in Pok√©mon Snap where, after certain steps are taken, a 
		Magikarp will splash its way into a waterfall where it evolves."
